# 159.261 Game Programming (Assignment 1)

## Brief
This is an implementation of a classic "snake game". The idea of a snake game originated in 1976 within an arcade game named [Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_(video_game)).

The snake game type has subsequently spawned many, many clones, and even spawned its own [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). 

This implementation is more closely modelled upon [nibbles.bas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)) from Rick Raddatz in 1991 than the classic game Blockade.

## Game Features
 - Simple menu system
 - Single player and two players support
 - Application state machine: get ready, playing game, level complete, etc
 - Apples that must be be collected in sequence 1-9
 - 10 levels
 - Walls randomly inserted during the map
 - Power ups (inc speed, dec speed, inc points, dec points, inc snakes, dec snakes, dec length, random)

## Engine Features
 - LWJGL integration
 - OpenGL 4.5, with GLSL shaders
 - Directional specular lighting
 - Mix of 2D and 3D graphics
 - Bullet3 integration (used for Snake deaths)

## Building and running the project
I built this will IntelliJ, but it also builds with Eclipse.

### Dependencies
 - [Libbulletjme](https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme). This project provides the ability to use the Bullet Physics engine within Java.
 - [LWJGL - Lightweight Java Game Library 3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases). This project provides access to OpenGL and GLSL shaders.
 - [JOML â€“ Java OpenGL Math Library](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML). This project provides Vector and Matrix maths routines that slot in well to LWJGL.

### Setup
I created a local directory named `C:\Development\159.261-Game-Prog-Assgn1`. I created a subdirectory within this directory named `lib`.

The JDK I'm using is `openjdk-16`.

### Libbulletjme
Go to this link https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme/releases/tag/10.5.0  
Download these files. Store them in the directory `lib`.  
`Libbulletjme-10.5.0.jar`  
`Libbulletjme-10.5.0-javadoc.jar`  
`Libbulletjme-10.5.0-sources.jar`  
`Windows32DebugDp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows32DebugSp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows32ReleaseDp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows32ReleaseSp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows64DebugDp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows64DebugSp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows64ReleaseDp_bulletjme.dll`  
`Windows64ReleaseSp_bulletjme.dll`  

### LWJGL
Go to this link https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases  
Download the file `lwjgl-3.2.3.zip`.  
Unzip it into the directory `lib`. It will make 38 subdirectories.  
 
### JOML
Go to this link https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML/releases/tag/1.10.1  
Download these files. Store them in the directory `lib`.  
`joml-1.10.1-sources.jar`  
`joml-1.10.1.jar`  
`joml-jdk8-1.10.1.jar`  

### Setup dependencies
#### IntelliJ
Click `File` -> `Project Structure` to open a dialog. From within the `Libraries` item, add the directory `lib` as a dependency, and also each of the `lwjglXXX` subdirectories within `lib` as dependencies.

Add a `Run/Debug Configuration` of type `Application`. Specify `com.snakegame.application.Application` as the entry point.

A this point the project should build and run.

#### Eclipse
Click `File` -> `New` -> `New Project`. A dialog opens. I called the project `Snake`, and used the location `C:\Development\159.261-Game-Prog-Assgn1`. Click `Finish`.
