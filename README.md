- ~~create the barn sides out of individual planks of wood~~
- ~~add doors to the barn~~
- ~~recreate the diffuse texture for the in-game apples~~
- ~~animate the in-game apples by rotating around the y-axis and bobbing up and down~~
- animate the toolbar text by increasing the text size when:
  - awarding a life or removing a life
  - adding points or removing points
- create the power-up meshes  
- ~~animate the power-ups by rotating around the y-axis and bobbing up and down~~
- update the toolbar background texture by adding a gradient similar to the menu
- animate the toolbar background
- correct the glow around panel graphics
- create final meshes for the snakes:
  - head mesh (1 blue, 1 red)
  - corner mesh (1 blue, 1 red)
  - straight mesh (1 blue, 1 red)
